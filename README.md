# Miscellaneous
Right now, I'm planning on making a website that's basically just stuff I should remember. May or may not be useful for others. I'm using a Source/Goldsrc style taken from https://github.com/xVenti/vgui.css, because I just thought it looked cool. I don't know why I used that fork specifically, because I don't think I'm going to be using the greysteam style, but whatever.

xVenti and AlpyneDreams, for the Source/Goldsrc style
