# Miscellaneous
A bunch of stuff that I feel doesn't deserve its own repository.

Right now, I'm planning on making a website that's basically just stuff I should remember for all my Source stuff. I'll be using a Source/Goldsrc style taken from https://github.com/xVenti/vgui.css, because I just thought it looked cool.
