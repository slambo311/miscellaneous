# Miscellaneous
Right now, this is basically a website that's just some stuff I should remember. May or may not be useful for others. I'm using a Source/Goldsrc style taken from https://github.com/xVenti/vgui.css, because I just thought it looked cool. Includes my opinion on TF2 and it's community, because I got off-track while trying to make something that convinces people not to kill friendlies. Oh yeah, it also includes a "style selector", swapping between the Greensteam, Greysteam, and Blacksteam styles. Different HTML files, though, and I'm lazy, so sometimes Blacksteam and Greysteam can be outdated. Greensteam's always the most up-to-date, though. Assuming I learn "proper" programming, I might make something that either makes the style switch without changing HTML files, or automatically updates the other 2 HTML files.
