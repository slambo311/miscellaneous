			<p>Use nodraw before hollowing out the starting cube, then change the interior textures, preferably to 2D or 3D skybox.</p>
			<p>Making Portal tests in hammer is a pain, you have to use a bunch of crappy prefabs, and have the room be JUST the right size, and the textures have to be JUST right, or it'll look terrible. Just use BEE2 (maybe even edit BEE2 levels). However, once Portal 2 Community Edition comes out, go ahead.</p>
			<p>Remember, displacements exist. Use them.</p>

		<div class="window no-resize" name="Source Filmmaker">
			<p>Use the "rigs" that add more settings for cameras and lights.</p>
			<p>To bonemerge/parent, drag the parent animation set onto the child animation set. Then, while selecting the child animation set, use the "Zero" preset. Finally, select the child animation set's flexes (if it has any), and set them to default. This method can also be used to replace models.</p>
			<p>I'd recommend against using recordings to make things animatable, it is a pain to figure out which things are which.</p>
			<p>Maps without lighting are useful for if you want to use JUST your own lighting.</p>
			<p>I'd recommend making a 2D drawing of the scene you want to make first, so you not only know what you want to make, but you can have a reference image to base it after. For actual animations, make a storyboard, and use less detail, so you spend more time in SFM than the drawing.</p>

		<div class="window no-resize" name="Team Fortress 2"
			<p>Stay away from 2fort. I know it's great, but staying on 2fort can prevent you from getting better at TF2. Break away from the endless cycle of 2fort, and try Dustbowl for a change.</p>
			<p>Make sure to set sv_allow_point_servercommand to always, so maps like tr_walkway will actually work.</p>
			<p>Also, know your limits. There's no cowardice in running from a clearly superior enemy. If you see almost the entire enemy team, run for your life.</p>
			<p>Remember, if you rage when getting killed, you're not a friendly.</p>
			<h1>My opinion on TF2 and it's community for some reason</h1>
			<p>TF2's community shaped the game into what it is today, and without all of their content, who knows what would become of TF2. A fan-made "Team Fortress 3" animation shows that TF2 is more than just a game. It has references from almost every era of TF2's memes, jokes, fads, and more. Hell, after years of no major TF2 updates, the community revived TF2 from the dead, bringing us some of the best updates, both for people making custom content for TF2, and regular players. One of the more recent updates gave us vscripts, a tool for mappers that simplifies many tedious and complicated things in Hammer.</p>

			<p>Remember to mess around. Who needs half an hour long tutorials when you can learn by crashing Blender 50 times in a row?</p>
			<p>Subdivide multiple times to lag the hell out of everything.</p>

		<div class="window no-resize" name="Weapon scripts">
			<p>The bucket values control the weapon's slot. 0,0 is the crowbar, not 1,1.</p>
			<p>Make sure that every printname and slot is different.</p>
