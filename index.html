			<p>Use nodraw before hollowing out the starting cube, then change the interior textures, preferably to 2D or 3D skybox.</p>
			<p>Do not, I repeat, DO NOT make Portal tests in Hammer. Changing the size of the room and aligning textures WILL destroy your sanity.</p>

		<div class=window name="Source Filmmaker">
			<p>Use the "rigs" that add more settings for cameras and lights</p>
			<p>To bonemerge/parent, drag the parent animation set onto the child animation set. Then, while selecting the child animation set, use the "Zero" preset. Finally, select the child animation set's flexes (if it has any), and set them to default. This method can also be used to replace models.</p>
			<p>I'd recommend against using recordings to make things animatable, it is a pain to figure out which things are which.</p>
			<p>Maps without lighting are useful for if you want to use JUST your own lighting.</p>
			<p>I'd recommend making a 2D drawing of the scene you want to make first, so you not only know what you want to make, but you can have a reference image to base it after. For actual animations, make a storyboard, and use less detail, so you spend more time in SFM than the drawing.</p>

		     <p>Stay away from 2fort. I know it's great, but staying on 2fort can prevent you from getting better at TF2. Break away from the endless cycle of 2fort, and try Dustbowl for a change.</p>
		     <p>Make sure to set sv_allow_pointcommand to always, so tr_walkway will actually work</p>
