			<p>Use nodraw before hollowing out the starting cube, THEN change the interior textures. This will significantly speed up the map-making process, as you don't need to change every single non-visible face just because you hollowed it out first.</p>
			<p>Making Portal tests in hammer is a pain, you have to use a bunch of crappy prefabs, and have the room be JUST the right size, and the textures have to be JUST right, or it'll look terrible. Just use BEE2 (maybe even edit BEE2 levels). However, once Portal 2 Community Edition comes out, go ahead.</p>
			<p>Remember, displacements exist. Use them.</p>
			<p>Goldsrc maps may be easier than Source maps.</p>

		<div class="window no-resize" name="Source Filmmaker">
			<p>To bonemerge/parent, drag the parent animation set onto the child animation set. Then, while selecting the child animation set, use the "Zero" preset. Finally, select the child animation set's flexes (if it has any), and set them to default. This method can also be used to replace models.</p>
			<p>When recording, make sure that you only record what is needed.</p>
			<p>Maps without lighting are useful for if you want to use JUST your own lighting.</p>
			<p>Remember to visualize in your head what you want to make before making it.</p>
			<p>Medic and Sniper's models have similar structure, and bonemerging them will rarely cause any problems.</p>

		<div class="window no-resize" name="Team Fortress 2"
			<p>Stay away from 2fort. I know it's great, but staying on 2fort can prevent you from getting better at TF2. Break away from the endless cycle of 2fort, and try Dustbowl or Doublecross.</p>
			<p>Make sure to set sv_allow_point_servercommand to always, so maps like tr_walkway will actually work.</p>
			<p>Also, know your limits. There's no cowardice in running from a clearly superior enemy. If you see almost the entire enemy team, run for your life.</p>
			<p>Remember, if you rage when getting killed, you're not a friendly.</p>
			<h1>My opinion on TF2 and it's community for some reason:</h1>
			<p>TF2's community shaped the game into what it is today, and without all of their content, who knows what would become of TF2. A fan-made "Team Fortress 3" animation shows that TF2 is more than just a game. It has references from almost every era of TF2's memes, jokes, fads, and more. Hell, after years of no major TF2 updates, the community revived TF2 from the dead, bringing us some of the best updates, both for people making custom content for TF2, and regular players. One of the more recent updates gave us vscripts, a tool for mappers that simplifies many tedious and complicated things in Hammer.</p>

		<div class="window no-resize" name="Modelling">
			<p>Remember to mess around. Who needs half an hour long tutorials when you can learn by crashing Blender 50 times in a row?</p>
			<p>Subdivide multiple times to lag the hell out of everything.</p>
			<p>When importing Source models, remember that with the wrong settings, all the models' parts will be stuffed into one spot.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="window no-resize" name="Weapon scripts">
			<p>The bucket values control the weapon's slot. 0,0 is the crowbar, not 1,1.</p>
			<p>Make sure that every printname and slot is different.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="window no-resize" name="Other bullcrap">
			<p>Remember, when playing Unreal Engine 4 games, check to see if the devs made the stupid mistake of leaving the console enabled BEFORE you use the Universal UE4 Unlocker.</p>
			<p>Default portal size in Portal 2: portals_resizeall 33 55</p>
			<p>sv_monster_turret_velocity exists, default is 100. Controls Frankenturret velocity, obviously</p>
			<p>It's "ent_fire !picker", not "ent_fire !pointer".</p>
			<h1>Interesting Portal entities:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>prop_scaled_cube: Sixense, self-explanatory. Cube that changes size.</li>
				<li>Contraption Cube: Education, with adjustable mass, friction, elasticity.</li>
				<li>Skull cube: Still Alive, connected to buttons that fizzle the cube. Not as interesting.</li>
				<li>npc_hover_turret: Portal 2 Unused, Turret with P1 core model, with laser and on a rope</li>
				<li>Electricity Fields, Hard Light Bridges, Laser Fields, and Crushers actually appear as early as Still Alive, some of them as early as the Portal Flash Version mappack, which Still Alive is partially based on.</li>
				<li>Adhesion and Reflection Gel: The well-known scrapped Portal 2 gels. Adhesion was scrapped due to motion sickness, and Reflection was presumably scrapped due to either being difficult to use or just that Reflection Cubes were better. In an earlier version of Portal 2, Adhesion Gel was still in the game, just unused. However, after people discovered it, Valve commented out the Adhesion Gel's code in an update, leaving only the Reflection Gel. Unfortunately, due to the update happening before/during the puzzlemaker update, the archived Portal 2 Education Edition likely also doesn't have Adhesion Gel.</li>
				<li>Walking Turret: Cut Portal 1 sentry, self-explanatory. Concept art shows them going through a portal, meaning they may have been much more deadly than other turrets, as standard turrets cannot shoot through portals, and let's be real, it's nearly impossible to unintentionally die to a rocket turret. This would have been a great challenge if it was in the game, as players would need to be careful about where they place their portals, and it is unknown how players would defeat walking turrets, assuming they COULD be defeated.</li>
			</ul>

		<div class="window no-resize" name="Notable maps and where to find them">
			<p>Note: All the Meet the Team maps have a lot of modifications and additions. MTM's map was only revealed in part of a SFM advertisement that included an early version of MTM.</p>
